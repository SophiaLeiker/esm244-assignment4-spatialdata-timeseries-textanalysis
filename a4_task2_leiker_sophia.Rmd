## 1. Introduction

This report will explore *time series assessments* of adult passage of coho, jack coho, and steelhead salmon in Willamette Falls. 

**Data Source:** The data used for analysis is from the [Columbia River DART Real Time Data Acess](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text). The database system is developed and maintained by the University of Washington School of Aquatic & Fish Sciences Columbia Basin Research Center. 

DART(Data Access in Real Time) provides interactive, timely access to integrated Columbia Basin salmonid, environmental, hydrosystem operations, riverine, ocean and climatic data resources. Includes raw and summary data, aggregate data analysis, stock status, ESU populations, conversion rates and fish-environment exposure information. All resources are publicly available.

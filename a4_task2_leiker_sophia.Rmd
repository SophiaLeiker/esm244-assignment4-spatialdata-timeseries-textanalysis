![Sky News: California Oil Spill 2021](https://e3.365dm.com/21/10/2048x1152/skynews-oil-spill-california_5542731.jpg)

## 1. Introduction

This report will carry out a spatial analysis using `tmap` to create an interactive map showing the location of soil spill events in california using the CA DFW Oil Spill Incident Tracking database. 

This report will also produce the creation of a finalized static choropleth map using `ggplot` in which the fill color for each county depends on the count of inland oil spill events by county for the 2008 oil spill data. 

**Data Source:** The data used for analysis is from the [CA DFW Oil Spill Incident Tracking dataset](https://map.dfg.ca.gov/metadata/ds0394.html). The database system is designed to provide OSPR with quantified statistical data on oil spill response by OSPR field responders. The OSPR Incident Tracking Database System project was initiated to provide OSPR with oil spill incident data for statistical evaluation and justification for program planning, drills and exercise training and development, legislative analysis, budget preparation, to inform and educate the public and analyze OSPR's overall spill preparedness and response performance. An "incident", for purposes of this database, is "a discharge or threatened discharge of petroleum or other deleterious material into the waters of the state."
